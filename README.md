# Aim Lab Wiki

Maybe we can replicate the templating system that MediaWiki uses to use with Browser Sync.

Figure out URL rewriting and replacing templates live.

For example:

```
<div id="content">
{{Header}}
</div>
```

The `{{Header}}` template should be replaced with the contents of the `header.html` file.
